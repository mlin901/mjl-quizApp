# mjl-quizApp

This homework assignment (the fourth assignment, due 4/18/21) is to "build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions." This app features objects, local data storage (and objects in local storage), dynamically updated HTML, event listeners, and more. It includes several HTML files, several .js files, and a CSS file.

Admittedly, one of the questions is not code related, but surely every professional (developers included) would benefit from knowledge of T.S Eliot's work.
